## Responsive Design
Designing for ultra-wide screens like 2K and 4K requires a thoughtful balance between responsiveness and readability. Here's a practical guide to help you build CSS layouts that scale beautifully without stretching too far:

### 1. Use a Max-Width Container
Wrap your content in a container with a max-width to prevent it from expanding endlessly on large screens:

```css
.wrapper {
  max-width: 1440px; /* or 1200px depending on your design */
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0 20px;
}
```
This keeps your layout centered and readable even on 4K displays.

### üìê 2. Apply Media Queries for Large Screens
Use media queries to fine-tune layout and typography for ultra-wide resolutions:
```css
@media screen and (min-width: 1920px) {
  body {
    font-size: 1.1vw; /* scales with viewport width */
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 2560px) {
  body {
    font-size: 1.2vw;
  }
}
```

###üìè 3. Use Responsive Units
Favor em, rem, vw, and vh over fixed px values to ensure scalability:

* clamp() is especially useful for fluid typography:
```css
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 2vw, 3rem);
}
```

###üß∞ 4. Set Breakpoints Thoughtfully
Define breakpoints that include ultra-wide screens:
```css
@media (min-width: 2560px) {
  .grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  }
}
```
